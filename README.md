### Generative modeling for time series via Schrödinger bridge 

This repository reproduces the results of :
- [Hamdouche, Henry-Labordere and Pham (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05093),
- [Alouadi, Barreau, Carlier and Pham (2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02943).

We implement: 
- a complete backtest of this method by performing deep hedging of a call option on the `AAPL` ticker (see `test_DeepHedging.ipynb`).
